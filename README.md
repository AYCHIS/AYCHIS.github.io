## Welcome to the IPT Repository including Wiki and Issue Manager! 

Inside this repository you can find the [IPT User Manual](IPT2ManualNotes.wiki) and a variety of other valuable resources aimed at users, coders and translators. If you're searching for a more complete description of this software, its uptake statistics, release history, or roadmap, please visit the [IPT Website](http://www.gbif.org/ipt) instead.

### About the IPT

The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is a free open source software tool written in Java that is used to publish and share biodiversity datasets through the GBIF network. The IPT can also be configured with either a DataCite or EZID account in order to assign DOIs to datasets transforming it into a data repository. 

### @Users

The easiest way to start using the IPT is to request a free account on a [data hosting centre](https://github.com/gbif/ipt/wiki/dataHostingCentres) that can provide you with an account on their IPT, allowing you to manage your own datasets and publish them through GBIF.org. 

If you're interested in trying out the IPT please send an email to helpdesk@gbif.org requesting an account on the [Demo IPT instance](http://ipt.gbif.org). 

Otherwise if you're interested in installing the IPT on your own server start by reading the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/gbif/ipt/wiki/IPT2ManualNotes.wiki#getting-started-guide). 

### @Coders 

The core development of the IPT is directed by GBIF, but the coding is a community effort and everyone is welcome to join. Scan the list of [open issues](https://github.com/gbif/ipt/issues) for ideas on how you can get involved. Contributions are welcome in the form of a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) using a branch or fork of the repository. Full instructions aimed at coders can be found [here](HowToContribute.wiki).

### @Translators

The IPT user interface and user manual both need internationalisation. Internationalisation is a community effort, and everyone is welcome to join. Full instructions aimed at translators can be found [here](HowToTranslate.wiki).
